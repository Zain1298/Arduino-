<p> Arduino is a single-board microcontroller designed to make the process of using electronics in multidiciplinary projects more accessible.The hardware consists of simple open-source hardware board designed around an 8-bit Atmel AVRmicrocontroller,though a new model has been designed around 32-bit Atmel ARM.The software consits of a standard programming language compiler and a boot loader that executes on the microcontroller.</p>	
<p>The Arduino board is made up of an Atmel <strong>AVR</strong> microprocessor,a crystal or oscillator(a acrude clock that sends time pulses at a specified frequency to enable it to operate at the constant speed) and a 5V voltage regulator.The board exposes the microcontroller's I/O(input/output) pins to enbale you to connect those pins to other circuits ot to sensors etc.</p>
<p>To program the Arduino,you also use the Arduino IDE,which is a piece of free software that enables you to program in the language that the Arduino understands.The language is C/C++.The IDE enables you to write a computer program,which is a set of step-by-step instructions that you then uplolad to the Arduino.Your Arduino will then carry out the instructions and interact with whatever you have connected to it.In the Arduino world,progrmas are knowns as "sketches".</p>
<p>The Arduino can also be extended with the use of "shields" which are circuit boards containing other devices(for example,GPS receivers,LCD displays etc) that can simply connect to the top of your Arduino to get extra functionality.</p>
<p>Arduino Uno has 14 digital input/output pins (out of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog input pins, a USB connection, A Power barrel jack, an ICSP header and a reset button.</p>

	<ul>
<li>Serial Pins 0 (Rx) and 1 (Tx): Rx and Tx pins are used to receive and transmit TTL serial data. They are connected with the corresponding ATmega328P USB to TTL serial chip.</li>
<li>External Interrupt Pins 2 and 3: These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value.</li>
<li>PWM Pins 3, 5, 6, 9 and 11: These pins provide an 8-bit PWM output by using analogWrite() function.</li>
<li>SPI Pins 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO) and 13 (SCK): These pins are used for SPI communication.</li>

</ul>
	<p>
		By using Arduino with sensors different projects can be made:
		<ul>
			<li>IOT Weather Reporting System</li>
			<li>IOT Patient Health Monitoring Project</li>
			<li>Smart Attendance System</li>
			<li>Solar Powered Water Trash Collector</li>
			<li>IOT based Intelligent Gas Leakage Detector </li>
			<li>Ultrasonic Blind Walking Stick</li>
		</ul>
